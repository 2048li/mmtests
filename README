This is a basic test suite that runs a number of common workloads of
interest to MM developers. The ideal would have been similar integration
or layout to either LTP, xfstests or base it upon autotest - Phoronix
Test being another possibility. Unfortunately, large portions of these
tests are cobbled together over a number of years with varying degrees
of quality before test frameworks for this sort of testing was common.
The refactoring effort to integrate with another framework is significant.

This is an early prototype based on code hacked for a specific test
environment. Hence, there might be still a number of bugs that are depending
on non-existant scripts or hard-coded paths that are not available. Buyer
Beware.

vmr/ contains portions of an ancient tool called VMRegress. Relevant
portions from it are being copied in as necessary rather than redeveloping
or preparing that tool for public release. stat/ also constains simple
helpers from VMRegress related to statistics.

The top-level directory has a single driver script called run-mmtests.sh
which reads the config file and runs the requested tests.

Each test is driven by a run-TESTNAME.sh script. This reads the config,
takes any necessary additional steps and calls the appropriate shellpack.

Shellpacks are a pairing of a bench and install script in shellpacks/. There
is another tool that can assemble these shellpacks and manage them but they
are not releasable yet.
